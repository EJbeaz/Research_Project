This scientific research project investigates the complex phenomenon of home advantage (HA) in sports, aiming to enhance our current understanding of its multifaceted nature. The study begins by comprehensively reviewing existing literature on HA, spanning various sports, and considering factors such as team dynamics, scheduling, environmental influences, and gender disparities. Notably, this research bridges gaps in current knowledge by analysing HA in different sports contexts, exploring the impact of balanced vs. unbalanced scheduling, evaluating the role of a sport's inherent nature, and examining the influence of environmental factors on performance outcomes. HA was reported in each of the disciplines under inspection. Variations in the recorded HA magnitude between these disciplines was also found to be statistically significant.
The study also delves into the realm of predictive modelling using machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically focusing on HA in football. It extends the existing ML-driven sports prediction modelling studies by employing both traditional methods and modern deep learning techniques, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of predictive capabilities. The XGBoost and recurrent neural network prediction models achieved the greatest overall accuracy, each scoring 64% in its prediction of home team win probability.
